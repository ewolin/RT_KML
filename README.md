# RT_KML
Grab tickets from RT, DQA metrics, etc. and show in a Google Earth KML to assist with maintenance planning and quality control.

Run getRT.sh to download a tsv report of active or stalled tickets for US, N4, GSN stations

Run rt2kml.py to grab DQA metrics and generate a KML with station status info, links to tickets, etc.

Must be on USGS network or VPN for this to work!
